# LineageOS for raphael (Xiaomi MI 9T Pro / Redmi K20 Pro)

## About

This project is meant to give us more freedom and security. It will allow everone to build their own lineageOS at home for their raphael phone.  By this, you will not have to wait anymore for other developers to do the building for you. In the current state, the phone has only one person at XDA who is building LineageOS for raphael. The latest build is from February (as of 10.05.2021). This means that it lacks all security updates in between and it is a high security risk.
